       <h2>HTML</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>Hyper Text Markup Language is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
        <li>HTML is made of elements that work toghether to provide content and basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
        <li>Elements include: Text, Image, Header, List</li>
        <li>Common element types used to divide and describe a page: Meta-related, Content division, Semantic
        <li>Angle brackets represent HTML elements</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>HTML elements used by the browser so the page renders correctly include: !DOCTYPE html, html, head, meta, and title</li>
        <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called Child elements.</li>
        <li>The element that holds all the children is known as the Parent element.</li>
        <li>In Semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage. It is important to use because they make your HTML easier to read by other developers and the browser.</li>
        <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is contained between an opening tag and a closing tag with angle brackets and tag names contained inside.</li>
        <li>Closing tags begin with a forward slash</li>
        <li>h1 through h6 represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
        <li>The p element represents paragraphs</li>
        <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. These HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists</li>
        <li>The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
        <li>The br element creates a line of empty space or a line break between two blocks of content</li>
        <li>The a element (anchor) creates links to the same or other webpages</li>
        <li>The main holds code</li>
        <li>The footer element appears ath the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
        <li>Remember, the elements give structure to content on a webpage without them, the content would be hard to read and difficult to style.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets is the language used to describe the presentation of a website that's created with HTML and how each element is rendered</li>
          <li>Example of CSS is using the style attribute</li>
          <li>To style and element directly in the HTML file, use inline CSS. This is useful for quick and permanent changes but are less felxible.</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. This is called an internal style sheet.</li>
          <li>Most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS stylesheet because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>When using an external stylesheet we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML'S head.</li>
          <li>Selector: defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations apply.</li>
          <li>Declarations: contain two important components, the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>Margin: acts like a margin in a word processing document and indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>Padding: adds space around the content inside an element, when you increase padding you are making an entire element bigger.</li>
          <li>Use an asterisk symbol to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>DRY: Do not Repeat Yourself, reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained. This can reduce overall size and complexity of a code base.</li>
          <li>Use positioning property text-align to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Class attribute allows us to share CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>Then class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule. (Example: .card)</li>
          <li>Hexadecimal code (Hex #) defines color.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>GitHub is the web interface for Git, a version control software that allows multiple people to make separate changes to a program at the same time without getting in eachothers way.</li>
          <li>Every project on GitHub is called a repository (repo.) A folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history.</li>
          <li>A branch is a workspace where you can make changes that don't affect the live site.</li>
          <li>Markdown (.md) is the way files are formatted in GitHub.</li>
          <li>A Commit saves a new version of a file you're working on. Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file you're making a commit.</li>
          <li>A Pull Request (PR) asks for changes on a branch to merge into another branch. Withtin a pull request you will see a list of commits.</li>
          <li>A PR gives the ability to have your work reviewed, discussed, approved, to get others to look at it and say yes or no to get it published ultimately.</li>
          <li>When a PR is approved, changes are pulled in or Merged into the main branch. Changes publish to the live site once this happens.</li>
          <li>An Issue is a way to report new tasks or content fixes. Open an issue for a new task and close once done. Include attachements if any. Label issues precisely for best organization.</li>
          <li>For best results use GitHub Flow as follows: Create a branch, Commit and push changes to your branch, Create a PR, Discuss and review the PR then Merge after approval, Delete your merge branch.</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: the add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area, the -A indicates we want to add all changes, the staging area informs git that the changes will be added in the next commit</li>
          <li>git commit -m "insert commit message here": locates specific Commit</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: checks if your local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub</li>
          <li>It is important to always do a git pull to make sure that you have the latest version of the project on your local computer before you start to work.</li>
          <li>git push origin branch-name: pushes your changes to the remote branch </li>
