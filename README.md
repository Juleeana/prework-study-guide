# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was driven by failure turned into success due to determination and focus. The project contains useful information for beginner web developers to fall back on when our minds become overloaded with information. The Prework Study Guide webpage will help you remember important Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics especially useful for building web applications. Durning the course of this project I learned how to use Github for a steady work flow, HTML for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript for function. All must-haves for an efficient web application.
